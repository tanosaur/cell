## Summary of decisions

### 24 Oct 2019
Next focuses:
- UI
- Tab bar/time zones
- Virality/message

### Building for myself
*Build for utility, thus profit*

### Test with integrity
*To honor the value hypothesis, for example: if the hypothesis is 'that the graphical 'Cell' interface is intuitive, addictive', test with this interface (and not earlier)*

### Swift, not React Native
*iOS custom keyboards are better in Swift*

### Custom keyboard, not iMessage app
*Building cross-platform for Android & iOS first - my parents have Android phones*

### Simplifications
*Until resource,*
- *iOS then Android*
- *User manually inputs the other person's time zone, then explore databases/permissions to automatically get the other person's time zone*

### Time awareness
*Recording all activities & their time via Toggl*
