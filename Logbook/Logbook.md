## 19-26 Sept: A week back at it

### A UICollectionView

Deciding between UITableView, UIScrollView, and UICollectionView. Learning and implementing UICollectionView.

### Implementing data for UICollectionView 

What an interesting day! A lot of wrangling with Apple's native date, time, and calendar formats. FYI, there are: `Date`, `Calendar`,  `DateComponent`, and `DateFormatter`, all with  different roles. I was determined to use as much of Apple's formats as possible. I do see the advantage of keeping my model's selected times in `Date`'s absolute time format i.e. extensibility, interfacing. Yet, in other parts of the program, now I wonder if it can be simpler writing my own data formats, using Apple formats as needed.

### Moving into custom keyboard & debugging

Debugging custom keyboard extensions - what a hairy thing! Lack of support and clarity from Apple, investigated and trialled Reveal debugger. On iOS application 'bundles' and 'packages':

"Think of a package as a box (ðŸ“¦) whose contents are sealed away and are considered to exist as a single entity. Contrast that with bundles, which are more like backpacks (ðŸŽ’) â€” each with special pockets and compartments for carrying whatever you need, and coming in different configurations depending on whether itâ€™s for taking to school, work, or the gym. If somethingâ€™s both a bundle and a package, itâ€™s like a piece of luggage (ðŸ§³): sealed like a box and organized into compartments like a backpack." - [Bundles and Packages, NS Hipster](https://nshipster.com/bundles-and-packages/)

## Fri 18 Oct

Back at it with focus of creating a great product. What I want now:
- Shortcut to ABC keyboard
- Improved UI

### Shortcut to ABC keyboard

From a surface investigation, seems that I can't create a button to shortcut to the system keyboard. The second best is to place the next keyboard button as closely/intuitively as the one on the main keyboard, and clean up memory/function/delay issues.

- Investigating shortcut to system keyboard 0:27

### UI

I'm excited to build this UI. I still dislike that I haven't resolved the keyboard height. Let's go!

- Photoshop mock, playing around 1:38

Different send buttons

Different cells

Thicker - loved this in initial design, when many, too much

Thinner

Fine to do mocks, want energy to go into the live rendition, and practical thought.
- Numbers? Hours?
- Space?

Overall, I'm happy with how I'm going and glad I chose to build in this direction now (still public, no published updates/story, own logbook)

## Sat 19 Oct

The most effective things I can do in 3 hours:
- set up, lay out UI on build
- use, tweak, graphics as I go


- Set up and lay out UI 1:26

Interesting! Good to know. Best now is to break it down into small chunks to investigate and manage.

- Finishing the AutoLayout of elements
- The xib, classes method
- The all in the View Controller method
- Potentially looking into PureLayout

Four tasks as a 'to do'.

## Mon 21 Oct

Does this work?
